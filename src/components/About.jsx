        <p>Hello my name is Gerardo and I am a Software Engineer located in the Bronx, New York. I am committed to helping others achieve excellence who wants to contribute to building a product that will benefit the user. As a camp counselor and trainer, I worked with many different types of people with many different backgrounds and pushed them to try new experiences and achieve their individual goals. Now I want to build digital products that can help people in similar ways. Throughout customer service, training, and mentoring opportunities I learned to communicate with teams, while also being individually dependent on the task at hand. I leverage these experiences as well as my drive to achieve progress to help debug any issues that will allow my team to produce a better product for the consumer. I want to expand my skills throughout the job and contribute as much as I can to the team overall.</p> */}
